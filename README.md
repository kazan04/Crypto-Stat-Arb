# Crypto-Liquidation-Cascades
Strategy to capitalize on liquidation cascades.
## Strategy Overview
This project implements a statistical arbitrage strategy that exploits **forced selling events** in the crypto markets â€” known as **liquidation cascades**. These occur when rapid price drops trigger leveraged traders' stop-outs, creating temporary mispricings that often revert.

> **Core Idea**: Identify liquidation-driven crashes across multiple assets, enter during panic, and profit from the mean reversion.

## Methodology

### 1. **Event Detection**
- Multi-timeframe price drops (1h and 2h)
- Volume spikes (top 5% percentile)
- Cross-asset correlation: â‰¥ 3 assets crashing simultaneously

### 2. **Trade Entry**
- Long entries triggered during high-volume cascade drops
- Entry at close of crash candle (simulated with shift)

### 3. **Trade Exit**
- Simple hold for 1â€“2 hours post entry (forward return logic)
- No stop-loss; profit is driven by mean-reverting bounce
